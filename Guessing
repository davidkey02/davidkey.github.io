Description of Game Flow
Start Game – The program begins execution.
Generate a Random Number – A number is chosen within a set range (e.g., 1–100).
Prompt User – The program asks the user to guess the number.
Validate Input – It checks if the input is a number.
If the input is invalid (e.g., text or symbol), an error message is shown and the prompt repeats.
Compare Guess – If valid, the guess is compared with the random number:
If too low: display "Too Low" and prompt again.
If too high: display "Too High" and prompt again.
If correct: display "Correct!" and end the game.
End Game – The game exits after a correct guess.
