#About me
## My Interests
Iâ€™m currently studying cybersecurity at Wake Tech and working toward a career in IT!!
Some of my interests include:
- Learning more and building PCs
- Plenty of competitive video games, and of course Mario Kart
- Exploring retro game emulation
- Going to conventions or traveling with friends
## Websites I recommend
- [TechSpot](https://www.techspot.com) - Great for keeping up with tech news, benchmarks, and reviews.
- [PCPartPicker](https://pcpartpicker.com) - I think this website is great for building computers, as it shows you compatibility, pricing, and functionality before you even buy anything.
